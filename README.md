# Rusty-Rubiks

##Project Description: 

The goal of this project is to make a Rubik’s Cube solver in Rust. The project scope may change depending on what is completed. Before moving to the next phase the previous phase must be completed. Beside each phase there is a recommended start date. 

### Phase 1 : Dec 15th 
  Set-up Github environment
  Representation of a 3x3x3 cube in rust 
  Ways to manipulate the cube 

### Phase 2: Jan 5th 
  Implementing Solver Algorithms
    Similar to a human 
    Extremely Optimized (Known as Korf’s Algorithim) 
    Using Machine Learning 

### Phase 3: Feb 25th 
  Making a 3d representation of the cube
  User inputs to alter the state of the cube 

### Phase 4: TBD
  Phases 1-3 for different sizes of cubes (4x4, 5x5 etc.)
  Making the code run faster
